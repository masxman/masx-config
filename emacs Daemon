Let your init system start it for you. In my case I have this systemd unit:

[Unit]
Description=Emacs text editor
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/keyring/ssh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

I saved it to ~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service and simply did systemctl enable --now --user emacs to have it start automatically with the machine.

To connect to it I use:

emacsclient -n -c -a emacs to start a frame as a GUI app

emacsclient -t -a '' to start is as a console/text only mode

If you fill in your $EDITOR and $VISUAL env vars you can simply issue sudoedit some-system-file and have all your sexy and cool config available to edit system files with no issues.
